I am a naval architect and assistant naval architect at Tech Marine Solutions Ltd., Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I work on hydrodynamic analysis, vessel motion response, and cargo loading feasibility for heavy marine transportation.

My research interests lie in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), marine hydrodynamics, and fluid–structure interaction, with a focus on seakeeping behavior, nonlinear wave–structure interaction, and offshore renewable energy systems. I have experience in numerical modeling of ship motions, multiphase flow, and unsteady flow phenomena using CFD tools.

I am particularly interested in applying high-fidelity simulations and data-driven approaches to improve the safety, energy efficiency, and sustainability of marine and offshore structures.
